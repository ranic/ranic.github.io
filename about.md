<p>
  Hi! I'm Vijay and I'm currently an infrastructure engineer at <a href="www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> in SF. Previously, I worked on Data at <a href="www.uber.com">Uber</a> and did my BS/MS in ECE at <a href="www.cmu.edu">CMU</a>. I deeply enjoy learning about and playing with new technologies (or whatever it is that's trending on HackerNews these days...). Outside of tech, I spend my time reading, running, bouldering, and traveling. With the inception of this blog, I hope to add writing to that list.
</p>
<p>
  I believe we will see immense benefits from automation over the next 20+ years. To this end, I'm looking out for opportunities to disrupt underserved industries like education and healthcare so that I too can make my dent in the universe.
