[Search Inside Yourself](#TODO){:target="_blank"}, by Google engineering veteran and self-proclaimed "Jolly Good Fellow" [Chade Meng](#TODO){:target="_blank"}, makes accessible the benefits mindfulness as a vehicle for achieving happiness and success. This book brims so densely with insight, that after finishing it on a plane, I spent 20 minutes collecting my thoughts (in true, mindful fashion), and opened up my laptop to write this review.

I want to first talk about Meng's writing style. I love it. Meng deconstructs a subject so abstract as meditation in a way that is simple, precise, and practical. He does this with an abundant use of lists. Whenever introducing a concept, he distills its substance into 3 - 5 key ideas or action items and delves into each in detail. This approach resonates with me in particular because I see the engineer's mind behind it; this is the divide and conquer approach. Break an abstruse problem into more digestible subproblems and solve each in turn. Perhaps imposing this rigid structure on mindfulness crops out abstract notions that are difficult to codify -- but who cares? If you can bring 80% of the benefits to 100x the people by making mindfulness more accessible, you've succeeded.

Meng groups the insights of the book into two parts: self-awareness and social intelligence. The first logically precedes the second: to understand others, you must better understand yourself. The two insights here that resonated with me are physiological self-awareness and separation of cause and effect.

### Self-Awareness

#### Physiological Self-Awareness ####

A high-level benefit of meditation is the ability to monitor and control one's own thoughts. But this is a highly abstract leap from the mental chaos we encounter day-to-day. Meng affirms that we must first bring awareness to the physiological side effects of our emotions. For example, observing your own heart rate increase when you hear something that offends you. Or observing your shoulders tense up after 20 minutes in a stressful meeting. Studies of participants engaged in stressful actvities have shown that our subconscious picks up on these physical manifestations of our emotions long before we admit to their existing. With mindfulness training (meditation), we pay attention to the sensations in our body. What if we could bring this into play in normal life? One exercise Meng suggests is to catch yourself in the moments after either euphoric or disappointing events and bring awareness to your physical reactions. As you train yourself to do this in less and less extreme cases, you reduce the delay time between subconscious and conscious self-awareness.

#### Separation of Cause and Effect ####

We often coalesce certain cause-effect pairs such that we take for granted that one begets the other. An example of such a pair is pain and suffering -- when you're in pain, you have no choice but to suffer. Meng's claim about self-awareness is that the truly aware individual can disaggregate these pairs. He presents a mindfulness exercise in which one simply observes one's physical (externally caused) pain and emotional (internally produced) suffering as a result of this pain. By repeatedly observing these two entities, we distinguish them and achieve the Zen master ability to accept pain without suffering. In general, this practice gives you the remote for your emotions and allows you to remain stable even as external factors change.

### Social Intelligence

The second set of insights in Search Inside Yourself concern social intelligence. This is the philosophy's main selling point; by practically tying meditation to social intelligence, Meng receives the support of organizations like Google, which thrive on the healthy relationships between their employees. The primary insight in of this section was a simple one: "recognize the humanity in others, everyone is just like me". By infusing your relationships with this mantra, you recognize that other people are just like you in their attempt to maximize happiness. This, combined with the improved social understanding that arises from better self-awareness, allows one to read social situations effectively and approach all relationships with love and kindness.

While in this section, Meng also provides several carefully planned exercises designed to improve your ability to work with others (e.g. sending/reading emails without assigning connotation, having difficult conversations with peers), I found this set of chapters not to be as valuable as the first. That being said, I'm not a manager and hvaen't had to deal with many politically charged interactions, so I may simply be privileged by omission.

<br/>
All in all, Meng's book is a fun and simple introduction to meditation as a means to becoming more mindful. Whether your goals are to be healthier, less volatile in your emotions, or better in communication with others, Search Inside Yourself provides practical exercises to make this happen. In terms of bringing mindfulness to the masses, a precursor to Meng's ultimate goal of World Peace for everyone, the book does a great service in providing clarity to an otherwise nebulous subject.
