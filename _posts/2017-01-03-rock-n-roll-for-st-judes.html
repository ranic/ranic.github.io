<p>
The first race I've signed up for this year is the <a href="http://www.runrocknroll.com/san-francisco/">SF Rock N' Roll Half Marathon</a> on March 26th. I hope to master the hills and beat my time on last July's SF Half (1:58).

This is also the first race I'm running for a charity, specifically the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. My goal is to raise $500 for St. Jude's foundation. Please donate via my fundraising link <a href="http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR/Heroes/Heroes?px=4371626&pg=personal&fr_id=59360">here</a>. Any contribution amount will really help the cause.
