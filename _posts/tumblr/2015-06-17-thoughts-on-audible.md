Having recently graduated and adjusting to the limbo between school and work, I finally had a chance to pick up one of my favorite writers’ latest book. Well, that’s not quite accurate; this book actually marked my first, and likely last, foray into the realm of audiobooks via Audible. Here, I’d like to give a quick breakdown of my impression of Audible as a platform for enjoying books.

### Pros
* Spares your eyes (and lets you listen in the dark)
* On your phone, so no need to carry another device
* Access to arguably the best audiobook repository.

### Cons
* Too passive of a medium, can get quite boring without looking at something
* The pace is usually either too fast or too slow (ameliorated somewhat by speed multiples)
* Somewhat expensive ($14.99/month for 1 audiobook)
* Audiobooks are by nature more limited than regular books
* Tough to go back and find a spot to re-read

Overall, I find that it’s a nifty tool with a growing collection of titles. That being said, I find listening to a reader who reads at a different pace than I think to limit my enjoyment of the content... I either feel like skipping ahead or going back to re-read.For the time being, I’m going to stick to my trusty Kindle.
