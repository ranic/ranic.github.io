<p>Yesterday, right before I sold my soul to tumblr, I finished reading Jhumpa Lahiri&rsquo;s <em>Unaccustomed Earth</em>. Already a Pulitzer Prize winner for her earlier short story collection, <em>Interpreter of Maladies, </em>Bengali-English author Lahiri once again paints a vivid portrait of the immigrant world, of life away from one&rsquo;s roots. The writing itself is flawless and ornate, but that&rsquo;s not what impresses me. The book consists of eight (for the most part) unrelated vignettes. Each one takes a completely different perspective on the themes that unify the book: separation, longing, redefining &lsquo;home&rsquo;. It amazes me how Lahiri can conjure so precisely the feelings of a little boy growing up in a foreign country, while simultaneously waxing eloquent on the trials of a man approaching old age. Her ability to shift perspectives, doing so in a manner that&rsquo;s both artistic and concise, makes her the <em>master</em>Â of the modern short story genre.</p>
<p><strong><em>5/5 stars. I highly recommend this book.</em></strong></p>
