<p><span></span>      So it&rsquo;s 1:32 AM, and in my languid state, I have sunk into tumblr-dom. I&rsquo;ve toyed with the idea for several months; initially to pass time during my final semester at IMSA, later to aid in the abandonment of Facebook-mania, and more recently in hopes of documenting my June trip to India with some modicum of orderliness. What stopped me all of those times was &ldquo;that little voice in my head&rdquo;, as some unwittingly describe it. I say &lsquo;unwittingly&rsquo; because that voice is far from little. Sure, it&rsquo;s invisible. But it&rsquo;s one of the <strong>loudest</strong> voices that plagues the human mind; worse than parents that never stop lecturing, worse than annoying acquaintances that you only pretend are friends, <em>even worse</em> than Justin Bieber&rsquo;s pre-pubescent shrills. The &ldquo;<strike>little </strike>voice in your head&rdquo; is the one that never shuts up, the one that tells you you aren&rsquo;t good enough, the one that stops you from trying new things. With a lot of effort, one can diminish that voice until it&rsquo;s small enough to be considered little. Until I reach that point, I&rsquo;ll pick a different adjective</p>
<p><span></span><span></span>      But I digress. Point is, while I am confident in both my writing and my opinions, I&rsquo;ve always been told (by that gargantuan voice) that I just don&rsquo;t have the artistic ability necessary to maintain a tumblr. I still don&rsquo;t believe I have that ability. Hopefully this website, with all its mystical powers, can prove me wrong.<img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loq2yfJNiD1qdk3uy.jpg"/></p>
