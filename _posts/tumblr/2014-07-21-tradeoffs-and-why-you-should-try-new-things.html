<p>Working on an infrastructure team, I hear about tradeoffs all the time. The art of tradeoff management (cost-benefit analysis, for the business-minded) constitutes the primary challenge of designing and implementing large-scale computer systems. Indeed, we even see this concept percolate the modern CS curriculum. Caching uses memory to avoid re-computation. No data structure is a panacea (despite the apotheosis of the hash table) as each makes its share of sacrifices for the conditional benefits afforded. The deeper I delve into the field, the clearer the importance of understanding tradeoffs appears.</p>
<p>This realization, as we all innately know, manifests in the non-computer world as well. Our decision-making process selects the course of action that minimizes pain and maximizes pleasure. At least, it should. Unfortunately (or perhaps not), this analysis is often hidden and sometimes absent altogether. In its stead, evolution has selected for the presence of various biases, which serve as simplifying heuristics. These biases are driven by several mechanisms, including belief fixation.</p>

<p>Belief fixation causes pre-existing beliefs to persist, despite evidence to the contrary. Suppose we believe in maintaining a schedule of working from 9 - 5, going to the gym afterward, cooking dinner, spending 2 hours on Netflix, and then going to bed. Over time, we receive may evidence contrary to our belief. This evidence may be explicit, such as feeling laggard/restless after so much TV that we stay up later, or implicit, if the gym is less crowded in the mornings and would lead to a more productive workout than in the evening. We resist acceptance of these beliefs, at least longer than we should. While this resistance is marginally helpful (it saves us from constantly deciding what to do next), it naturally becomes problematic.</p>
<p>How does one fight this bias? By considering tradeoffs, of course! Schedules are incredibly useful and help structure our days. But every once in a while, consider whether what you&rsquo;re doing is still relevant to the benefits you sought when you first created the schedule. Remember, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to continue on the set path&rdquo; is your bias talking &ndash; you incur opportunity cost, or the cost of losing out on what you <em>could have </em>been doing. Every week, take some time to re-evaluate the heuristics that underlie your life choices, considering the tradeoffs you are and could be making. </p>
<p>To get started, I&rsquo;ve mapped out the tradeoffs of evaluating tradeoffs!</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul><li><span>Combats belief fixation, an evolutionary bias that is no longer as relevant</span></li>
<li><span>Keeps you trying new things (and a rolling stone gathers no moss)</span></li>
<li><span>Grows your collection of experiences, which helps make more informed decisions</span></li>
<li><span>Cultivates your ability to adapt to changing circumstances</span></li>
<li><span>Encourages reflection on what works and what doesn&rsquo;t</span></li>
</ul><p><strong><span>Cons</span></strong></p>
<ul><li><span>Takes a little bit of time</span></li>
</ul><p><span>It&rsquo;s your call!</span></p>
