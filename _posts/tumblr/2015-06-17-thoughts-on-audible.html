<p>Having recently graduated and adjusting to the limbo between school and work, I finally had a chance to pick up one of my favorite writers’ latest book. Well, that’s not quite accurate &ndash; this book actually marked my first, and likely last, foray into the realm of audiobooks via Audible. Here, I’d like to give a quick breakdown of my impression of Audible as a platform for enjoying books.</p><p><b>Pros</b></p><ul><li>Spares your eyes (and lets you listen in the dark)</li><li>On your phone, so no need to carry another device</li><li>Access to arguably the best audiobook repository.</li></ul><p><b>Cons</b></p><ul><li>Too passive of a medium, can get quite boring without looking at something</li><li>The pace is usually either too fast or too slow</li><li>Somewhat expensive ($14.99/month for 1 audiobook)</li><li>Audiobooks are by nature more limited than regular books</li><li>Tough to go back and find a spot to re-read</li></ul><p>Overall, I find that it’s a nifty tool with a growing collection of titles. That being said, I find listening to a reader who reads at a different pace than I think to limit my enjoyment of the content&hellip; I either feel like skipping ahead or going back to re-read.</p><p>For the time being, I’m going to stick to my trusty Kindle.<br/></p>
