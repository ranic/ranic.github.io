<p>Last week, I listened to Jhumpa Lahiri’s latest novel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lowland">The Lowland</a></i>, on Audible. Here, I first describe my take on Lahiri’s writing style as a whole and then delve particularly into her latest book, discussing where it improves upon and deviates from her previous works.</p><p>Lahiri boasts a rich, precise vernacular that colors otherwise mundane objects in her stories. She portrays the visage of a Rhode Island beach by describing the visual appeal of the crisp blue waves against the lighter sky, the softness of sand between the toes, the unassuming white noise of waves reaching the shore. Such exposition gives the reader an appreciation for the sensory richness of human experience, deftly reminding us of “the little things” we so habitually take for granted.</p><p>Further, her novels embody themes that particularly resonate with me; the experience of an Indian abroad, familial struggles borne from this cultural dichotomy, and vast physical separation within such families. In addition, Lahiri exhibits profound empathy as a narrator. In one chapter, she is the nervous Indian graduate student coming abroad; in the next, she is his rebellious daughter, raised in America. In other chapters, she speaks from the perspective of his conservative mother or fundamentalist brother, masterfully maintaining and switching between each character’s context. <b>Together, her empathy and her descriptive language develop a rich, engaging novel around a simple plot.</b></p><!-- more --><p>Lahiri’s usual strengths come to play in <i>The Lowland</i>, which follows the members of a simple Bengali family living in Calcutta during the Naxalite (communist) movements in turbulent, post-partition India. One of the major arcs brings one of the sons to America, where he quickly assimilates, eventually even growing distant from the cultural context and strife of his hometown. At times, <i>The Lowland </i>seems to dabble in historical fiction, delving deeply into the characters involved in the Naxalite movement and highlighting the jarring effects that these agrarian revolutions had for many families in the region. This context assists the reader in assuming the perspectives of each of the protagonists.</p><p>One of the weak points of <i>The Lowland</i>, in my opinion, was that it took on too much. Lahiri’s previous novel, <i>The Namesake, </i>followed the development of the <b>sole</b> protagonist by anchoring on several major incidents in his life. Lahiri sped through the parts of his life between these periods, which kept the novel focused and allowed it to meaningfully come full circle by the end. In <i>The Lowland</i>, however, there are four or five main characters, each of whom is followed in incredible detail&hellip; not only for particular life events, but from their childhood to death! While this shows off Lahiri’s unique ability to put herself in many different shoes, it heavily dilutes the focus of the novel and causes it to drag aimlessly at times.</p><p>Overall, I find Lahiri’s writing style thoroughly enjoyable, and <i>The Lowland </i>highlighted her strengths well. Further, she demonstrates that she’s unafraid to provide social context, giving the reader a better appreciation for the struggles of the times. Finally, and more personally, I enjoy the little touches in the novel that only a fellow immigrant would understand; as always, Lahiri does great justice to these nuances of migration and cultural assimilation.</p><p>Definitely recommend this book &ndash; 4/5 stars.</p>
