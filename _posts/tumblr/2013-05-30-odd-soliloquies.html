<p>“And it took a left turn, and I was right there and the driver was like this maniac and…”</p>
<p>I tuned her out after this point. Pity is one thing, but really, how long can you actually pay attention to someone narrating their day to, wait for it, nobody?</p>
<p>There’s a surprising number of these characters on the Port Authority busses that serve as our main mode of transportation around Pittsburgh. They always sit in the front, and often occupy multiple seats/reek of smoke. So many questions enter my mind when I see them. Where do you come from? Where are you going? Who do you think you’re talking to? Do you notice me? Are you just waiting for someone to notice you?</p>
<p>Gross generalizations, perhaps. But these surface-level insights are all my observation has yielded. One day, I’ll have the pluck to sit next to one of these strangers… who knows, maybe a dialogue is what they’ve been seeking all along.</p>
