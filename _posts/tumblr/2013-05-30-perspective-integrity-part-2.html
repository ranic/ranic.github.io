<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>A constant struggle in our lives is mental; the civil war of “he said, she said” that dictates the (anything but) little voice in our heads. Perpetual and self-inflicted, this unending conversation comes from the myriad snap judgments we make on a daily basis. There is no truth to these judgments; rather, we assign boolean values to them based on our own perspectives. When they come into contact, these varied perspectives obviously cause conflict between people — leading inevitably to unhappiness.<!-- more --></p>
<p>The solution is simple: adopt multiple perspectives. “Duh Vijay, I understand other perspectives,” quips the smart-ass in the corner. Well, sure you do. But always? It’s easy to see others’ perspectives in times of happiness and success; in fact, in those times we embrace them. Yet in times of sadness, anger, misfortune, and strife… we’re trapped. When we get into an argument with a friend, our own perspective shines so brightly that we’re blind to the alternative. A true master in this regard has such control over perception that their ability to see it transcends the effects of mundane emotions. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we all color the world with our own crayons, call the sky blue and the grass green, and utter it with the qualifier of “truth.” But the truth is, color itself is a subjective construct. The ability to switch your color box with someone else’s as a conscious choice is a useful one. Multiple perspectives make one smarter in any given situation, granting greater power to make of it what they want: what makes them happy. Multiple perspectives allows one to empathize with others, strengthening bonds and developing relationships. Multiple perspectives allow you to <em>create</em> a perspective in which you are happy and let you <em>live it</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
<p>For a word that we have no trouble throwing around, integrity has a nebulous definition. Our good friends at MW consider it a “firm adherence to a moral or artistic code.” I define living a life with integrity as imbuing truth in all that one speaks and does; living by the code of honesty, so to speak. Consider this life in terms of time spent vs. value generated (it’s almost economic, isn’t it?). If we replaced all the time we spend deceiving others, and ourselves, with disciplined self-improvement, the truth suddenly becomes more fantastic than any lie could ever be. “Deceive” has a profoundly negative context, but I use it here to signify anything related to creating and maintaining an outward image. Act with integrity, and your inner self shines through that image, defining the <em>true </em>you in anyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>I cannot say that the journey of integrity is always pleasant (“the bitter truth” holds a lot of credence in this context); however, one can be sure that a life of integrity brings with it less time spent in sadness. Say what you will, but humans are <strong>hard-wired</strong> for happiness. Be true to your natural state and imbue this positivity. More concretely, integrity brings with it a love for the self. With an honest appreciation for who you are, it’s tough for anything external to bring you down.</p>
