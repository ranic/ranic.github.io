<p>abstinence. sobriety. lame.</p>
<p>These are all words I’ve heard to describe the practice of teetotalism, or the persistent act of refraining from consuming alcoholic beverages. I am a teetotaler and have often been asked why. It was, at first, simple to answer; formulaic, like any other question about myself. However, the question of abstinence from alcohol is inundating in college, and too often I’ve found that the flimsy, surface-deep answer that I provide simply doesn’t hold up. More than once I’ve found myself without response in a conversation about my choice not to drink, saved only by the short attention span of the incapacitated asker. Only afterward, after some objective thought, do I derive an answer. Tonight, I write about my decision in more concrete terms — outlining each reason individually — as a way to comprehend my own reasons before sharing them with anyone else.<!-- more --></p>

<p><strong>Self-control</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always prided myself on being in control at any given moment. This doesn’t solely mean having control of others’ perceptions of me; it includes restraint and control of my inner self. I don’t want to say that I’m afraid of losing it, but on a deeper level, I must be. It’s too much of who I am to not be protective of it. I feel that the consumption of alcohol greatly weakens this sense of control and isn’t worth it to the person I want to be. </p>
<p>A common response to this is that you only have the most fun when you’re not in control; that it’s important to step out of your comfort zone. A valid point, to most, but (and this is I think the greatest antidote to peer pressure, for those who seek it) <em>I am not the people around me. </em>I find bliss in situations that I have complete control over; and I often step out of my comfort zone and let myself go via writing, dancing, and love. That one needs alcohol to lose control and have a “certain kind of” fun is ridiculous; to each his own.</p>
<p><strong>Family and Values</strong></p>
<p>I feel that many would construe, from this heading alone, that I have some sort of moral obligation to avoid drinking, which comes with a right to judge those who do so on an ethical level. Perhaps this was true a year ago, but having seen a range of situations in which alcohol plays a part, I’ve realized how narrow-minded it is to generalize.</p>
<p>My close family is a tremendous part of my life; small as it may be, we are bound by our journey to the United States and pursuit of the American Dream. No, this isn’t a trailer for a new Indo-American hit movie, it’s true. I very seldom demonstrate the respect I have for my parents in being successful in this foreign, metal jungle — and for all the work they’ve done to deserve this respect, my parents rarely ask it of me. They’ve made only a few small requests of me, one of which was to avoid drugs and alcohol. To me, it is an injustice to their incredible investment in my success to take their money and use it to incapacitate and weaken myself. From a purely logical standpoint, it adds no value to me.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of sensory appeal</strong></p>
<p>In general, alcohol tastes bad, smells bad, and looks unappealing when (not if) it spills all over something you just cleaned up. If you count mentality as a sense, it loses even more appeal. I’ve asked several people, who’ve been heavy drinkers, whether they’ve done more things that they’ve regretted or enjoyed when drunk. The responses were mixed; most got pretty defensive… but the overall, somewhat objective consensus was that the bad things that happened when under the influence were so much worse than the good things were, well, good. It’s tough to convince me to do something unhealthy that’s incredibly unappealing to my senses and will lead me down many paths of regret. Peer pressure and values aside, I just don’t like the idea of doing so.</p>
<p>So I wrote a lot, and looking back, rambled with a bit too much fervor about my reasons for abstaining. Don’t worry, I’m not as zealous a teetotaler as those in the Prohibition era. I do, however, enjoy a heightened clarity about the reasons surrounding my oft-questioned decision. The bottom line is that it’s my own choice whether or not to drink and at this point in my life, I have good reasons for the one I’ve made. On a similar note, I’ve grown enough in college not to judge people solely for drinking (though perhaps for any actions they take while doing so). I respect their decisions as I expect them to respect mine - and who knows? Maybe one day I’ll understand their reasons as personally as I do my own.</p>
