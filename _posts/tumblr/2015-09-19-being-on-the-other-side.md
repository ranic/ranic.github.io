This past week, I had the fortune to return to Pittsburgh to recruit and interview at the EOC on behalf of Uber. I got the chance to market my company, observe seasoned engineers who have been recruiting for over a decade, and take lead on a few interviews. The experience was especially insightful since I myself was job hunting only one year ago; I had an appreciation for the candidate’s perspective while being forced to embody the context of the recruiter.

Here, I’d like to share some concrete insights that I hope will both help prospective candidates and make the recruiter’s life much easier; indeed, these goals are not mutually exclusive! By no means do I presume to be a professional on the subject; I merely want to document my thoughts on the process as a basis for what might become a more comprehensive and data-driven guide. With that disclaimer out of the way, here’s my advice for prospective tech candidates:

#### 1. Open with the information most logistically relevant to the recruiter ####

The sheer scale of recruiting, coupled with its time constraints, makes it a logistical nightmare. Here’s what we immediately want to know for every candidate: *full-time or intern? graduation date? type of role (e.g. data science, PM, software eng)? area of interest/prior work? why does Company XYZ interest you?*

Scrap your 30 second elevator pitch and start with this. It makes your recruiter’s life so much easier, and opens up time to stand out with more substantial discussion.

#### 2. Do not read your resumé aloud ####

Your resumé should read itself. Pointing at bullet points and paraphrasing them can be distracting and often detracts from the recruiter’s ability to clearly understand your abilities. Take some time to trim the fat from your resumé and highlight (with brevity) what you feel is most important. Like point 1, this saves time and avoids information overload.

#### 3. Prepare to discuss *any one* of your side projects ####

A very common question that interviewers, at least for engineering positions, will ask is to discuss a project that you’ve worked on or are proud of. Occasionally, we might pick out one on your resumé and ask about that. Be prepared to have a 3-5 minute discussion about anything on your resumé. Consider not only the implementation details, but the design decisions you made, how you tested it, how it would scale, and what to do to make it production ready. There’s usually not enough bandwidth to discuss more than one, so be prepared to go into depth on any one topic instead of into breadth on all of them.

#### 4. Ask *non-generic* questions about topics that genuinely interest you ####

The career fair goes both ways and is a great chance for you to find out more about companies. And yes, not asking a question when given the chance is a red flag. That being said, asking generic questions just for the sake of asking is equally damaging. It’s incredibly obvious to distinguish between a candidate genuinely listening to an answer vs. thinking about what to ask/say next. The best questions are the ones that demonstrate some prior research; e.g. asking about our tech stack and why we chose one tool over another. If you really don’t know much about the company, a good start is to ask the engineer about their daily work, listen intently, and build off of that. We tend to be very passionate about our work and can go on and on if asked the right questions. :)

#### 5. Know your basic computer science concepts ####

This one is common sense, but the sheer number of people who said to use [bubble sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8#t=0m30s) to solve a simple conceptual question compelled me to put it on here. More seriously, it’s also a red flag if you can’t discuss the complexity of an algorithm on your resumé. Know your basic algo/data structures and be solid on all projects/skills you put on your resumé. The rationale behind these quick, on-the-spot questions is simple. You will certainly be asked something similar, and more complex, in a phone or on-campus interview. It’s a waste of time (on both sides) to move to that round and then discover that the candidate is not as solid as they claim to be. It’s always best to be prepared early on.

These are the main insights I gleaned from my experience on the “other side” of the career fair! Some are low-hanging fruit, while others require a bit more preparation. Keep in mind that these are simply my opinions and not yet as time-tested as perhaps more “professional” advice. That being said, I’ll certainly augment this as I recruit more and I hope my perspective will prove valuable to prospective candidates and recruiters alike!
