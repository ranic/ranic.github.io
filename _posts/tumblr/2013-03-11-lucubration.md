There’s something magical about working late into the night. A sense of abandon, at once reckless and peaceful. Time elongates, morning is nowhere in sight. Your only companion is your desk lamp, whose soft illumination uncovers to the world your presence. The presence of someone deep in thought, swallowed by passion, silently at work. A drowsiness falls over you, but you welcome it. It shuts away the constant conversations in the back of your mind. “He said, she said” is finally put to rest. Your mind devotes its more limited resources to the task at hand, and for many an unacknowledged moment, you are happy.
