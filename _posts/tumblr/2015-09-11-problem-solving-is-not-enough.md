Being a software engineer is not all that it’s chalked up to be. Don’t get me wrong, we are some of the luckiest people out there when it comes to our work; we have liberal hours, free food, and great compensation. Companies compete to offer their own unique sets of benefits, like laundry service, beer on tap, free transportation, etc. Yet these perks simply constitute the proverbial cherry-on-top for the confident, starry-eyed college senior. The cake that we’re all so hungry for is **the chance to work on challenging problems that change the world.**

And for a couple of weeks, it’s great, as we bask in the benefits. But the cake? You catch glimpses of it here and there, but unlike the cherry, it isn’t handed to you on a plate. *You’re not going to get thrown interesting problems*. Those problems are outnumbered by the engineers that claim to be working on them. If you’re not careful, you will spend your time completing the never-ending stream of mundane tasks that fuel your company’s business. Sounds pretty disappointing; you might as well quit now.

Alright, enough with the cynicism; here’s the root of the issue. Throughout college, we’re told that engineering is all about being an excellent problem solver. And while fitting that archetype enables you to hit home runs when you have tasks lobbed over to you, you don’t have control over what exactly you’re hitting out of the park. Someone else, *with their own set of interests*, does. The ultimate issue is the following misconception: *you have what it takes to be a great engineer if and only if you’re a great problem solver*. **That’s false.**

To be a great engineer, you need to be both a problem solver and a **problem framer**. What does it mean to be a problem framer? I look at it as being able to codify the unknown. Instead of waiting for a problem to manifest itself, the problem framer identifies spaces in the existing solution and effectively constructs and manifests them as a new problem to solve. The problem framer is an active engineer that constantly seeks out, identifies, and mitigates issues before they even occur. This has two important benefits for the engineer. First, **it makes the engineer more indispensable to the company**. Second, **it puts the engineer back in the driver seat** in terms of working on exciting and challenging projects; ultimately, that’s what makes us happy.

“Well shoot, it must be depressing to realize this after X years of being told that problem solving is enough.” Not really. In fact, we all already do quite a bit of problem framing on a day to day basis. Some of the most useful problem solving techniques involve framing subproblems and piecing together their solutions (e.g. dynamic programming or induction). To become a better engineer, we simply have to scale this approach up. Take an hour out of your day to re-evaluate the efficacy of the way things are done; to motivate yourself, pick areas of interest to you. Write down any assumptions that you feel are flawed or issues that may crop up as components change. Find a way to integrate a solution you’ve seen work elsewhere. Back up your claims with data and play around with potential mitigation strategies. As you experiment, the scope of your endeavor will narrow and ultimately, you’ll arrive at a clear, well-defined problem that you fully own. Exciting, eh?

So where am I with respect to all this? I’m certainly no expert, but I’m fortunate to be working at a place where engineers are encouraged and expected to be problem framers from day 1. My goal is that over the next year, producing these interesting and challenging problems will become just as second nature (and fruitful) as consuming them!
