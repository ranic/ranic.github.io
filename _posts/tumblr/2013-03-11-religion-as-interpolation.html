<p>I’ve been thinking for the last few weeks about the meaning of faith, and more concretely, religion. Today, on my way back from the temple, I considered a mathematical interpretation of religion.<!-- more --></p>
<p><em>Interpolation </em>is the technique of fitting a curve to a set of data points. It is used in statistics to develop a more complete answer/meaning (curve) based on some observational evidence (data points). The better a particular curve fits a set of data, the more valid the interpretation that the curve represents. If two particular curves fit all the data points, smoothness is another criterion for validity. Here are two interpolations, courtesy of Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Which one do you prefer? They both hit all 7 points, matching input data, but the right one is a lot smoother. Humans, seeking the most aesthetic/beautiful explanation, would choose the latter. (By the way, the one on the left is called “piecewise linear” and the one on the right is called “piecewise polynomial” or “spline”). </p>
<p>I contend that religion is nothing but an interpolation. The data in this case is what we know about the world, the constantly growing set of human observations over our time on Earth. This includes physical observations (passing of seasons, sun rises in one direction and sets in another, all creatures grow and die) and emotional ones (love, fear, peace, loss). We understand that which we observe, but seek a higher explanation to tie all these points together. That explanation is our interpolation. That explanation is religion.</p>
<p>So why do only a few religions stand the test of time if all are interpolating the same world? As time passes, our observational data set grows larger and more concrete. That is, more points are added with greater certainty. Religious beliefs that die out are ones that cannot accomodate these developments. The ones that stand out are ones that remain consistent with modern systems of thought.</p>
<p>The interesting property of interpolation, though, is that there’s no single answer — just as with faith. An infinitude of curves can be developed to pass through a given set of points and their choice is truly arbitrary. Understanding this leads to understanding tolerance. We hang on to the interpretation that’s most meaningful to us, but others do the same. So long as theirs matches the observational data, we must accept it as valid, though we need not adopt it as our own interpretation. </p>
<p>So can I conclude that atheism (belief in nothing) and universalism (belief in everything) are the only valid systems in a universe where infinitely many theories are equally valid. <strong>No.</strong> This makes the assumption that everyone views the world with the same pair of eyes and consumes the same observational data. In reality, each one of us has a slightly different data set and we adopt the faith that most closely interpolates our own. In fact, we often adapt our faith to achieve a more customized fit. This disparity in perception underlies religious dichotomies.</p>
<p>Still, none of this is any justification for bloodshed in the name of your own faith. Understanding religion in this light is the ultimate means of tolerance. Just remember, your choice of belief is just as arbitrary as a mathematician’s choice of interpolating curve.</p>
