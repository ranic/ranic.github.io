<p>After an infernal 6 weeks, your prodigal author has finally returned to the land of the living for spring break. Time for 7 days of cathartic bliss on the beaches of Cancun and 6 nights of clubbing/picking up topless sunbathers.</p>
<p>Or so the story would go had I infinite money, true freedom from the throngs of academia, a fake ID, and least importantly, a desire to do those things. Instead, I spend my week away from Carnegie Mellon in a land as prosaic as the title of this post — my hometown of Vernon Hills, IL. (Now you know where I live, stalker score!)</p>
<p>Alright, now that we’re pretending that I’m blogging for reasons other than my resolution to write 100 posts this year, I’d like to talk for a bit about my semester so far and my plans for this break/the rest of the year.<!-- more --></p>
<p>College is all about prioritizing. You can achieve whatever you want if you want it enough to give up everything else (duh!). So if you want straight As, you can get them. Wanna be student body president? You got it. Looking to have so many hookups that you can’t store your count in an unsigned byte? Ambitious, given how nerdy that was, but certainly doable. </p>
<p>Alas, who only wants to excel in one area? It’s only natural, as the driven youth of America, to want to be good at everything. For me personally, this desire has manifested in a multitudinous approach to my extracurriculars, in addition to a growing courseload. And for half my college career, that’s worked, except…</p>
<p>This semester, I’ve decided to delve wholeheartedly into my classes. The ones I’m taking afford me a variety of technical skills (Java, MATLAB, Verilog), test my ability to manage a neverending deluge of assignments, and incentivize me to work with groups of like-minded individuals. More than that, it’s why I’m in school in the first place, right?</p>
<p>So for the first month of this semester, that’s what I did. I attended pretty much all my classes, finished assignments over a day in advance, went over my own notes for exams, etc. Sure I still had other activities to keep me busy, but this was my <strong>priority</strong>. And I realized that this school isn’t so academically difficult when you align your priorities with your expectations. I expect good grades, and if I prioritize in a manner consistent with that, I’ll get them.</p>
<p>And yet… this methodical approach to college life grows boring. You know you can finish that next assignment early, you know you can ace that next test, but there’s no pleasure or excitement in knowing. The excitement comes from risk, from things you may regret, from going out of your way to do something you wouldn’t normally do. And this leads to slip ups, rendering all of those hours of work a waste. Chaos, more enticing in the short run, is harmful months, weeks, even a few days in the future. In summary, I’ve been growing bored of the boy scout “get Straight As” lifestyle. Let’s see if there’s a way to find a middle ground between that and something more exciting (while achieving the results I’ve set out to achieve).</p>
<p>Anyway, this post went on an integral of sec^2 (these nerd jokes really need to stop). I’m doing a bit of reading this break, which I’ll discuss in a future post. I also want to write some reviews of two shows I’ve enjoyed/started to enjoy (Prison Break and House of Cards), so look out for that!</p>
