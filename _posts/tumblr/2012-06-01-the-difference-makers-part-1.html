<p>I’m blessed to live without a lack of basic necessities; I have clothes on my back, food on the table, a roof over my head. Beyond that, I have constant access to entertainment and leisure, a nigh infinite source of information at my fingertips, and plenty of interesting places to go within walking distance. Further still, I have a supportive family, friends with whom I can relate, and personal relationships strong/numerous enough to keep me afloat in times of success and strife alike. This underlying amalgamation is so simple, yet it, in a sense, defines the freedom one has to actually live their life. Before I continue this post and take my own fortune for granted, let’s take a moment to appreciate this multifaceted presence in our own lives.<!-- more --></p>
<p><span>Let’s make the assumption that these necessities are all taken care of (by listing them out, we see that it’s no so small an assumption to make). To those for whom this isn’t the case: I cannot address you accurately as I haven’t experienced your situation. This post addresses the other half, the privileged pantheon. We’re no better, simply luckier.</span></p>
<p>Now in spite of having everything we<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>“need,”</em> we find ourselves straddled on the roller coaster of life – heralding the highs and lamenting the lows. All measures out of our grasp, the assumptions we laid out above, point to a life of happiness and success. This implies that our emotional volatility is caused by factors within our control. So what are they? And how much control do we really have over them?</p>
<p>I claim that the two controllable “difference makers” in our lives are perspective and integrity. In the following post, I define these terms and describe how, in my opinion, their synthesis opens a realm of possibility in which we can embrace happiness and success as parts of our natural state of being.</p>
