<p class="p1"><em>I’m going to try to limit the amount of time I spend on my posts. Starting now, I’m allocating 3 minutes per post. Ready, set, go!</em></p>
<p class="p1">I know it’s an old show, but a close friend of mine suggested I watch it, and for this past semester, Prison Break has gotten me hooked. Here, I share my opinion on the show.</p>
<p class="p1">Now normally my opinion posts, when unstructured, go on for rambling paragraphs that are only vaguely on point. Instead, I’ll break down for you guys the good, the bad, and the ugly of my latest obsession.<!-- more --></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Good</strong></p>
<ul><li>The “oh shit” level at the end of each episode is INSANE. Definitely the most suspenseful show I’ve seen ever.</li>
<li>The storyline is extremely intricate — the writers make a great effort to involve every small detail at some point in the show.</li>
<li>The character base is extremely diverse, and each has a rich, well-explored backstory</li>
<li>Going off of that, the show makes everyone very human and thus relatable, albeit in different ways. This makes it a great point of conversation.</li>
</ul><p class="p1"><strong>Bad</strong></p>
<ul><li>The incredible suspense built into the story line comes with a bit of gaudiness. And after a while, it does get a bit formulaic.</li>
<li>The acting isn’t at a level commensurate with the storyline. It’s good, but not much more than that. And unfortunately, the actors don’t get any better over four seasons, so it can get irritating at times.</li>
<li>The last two seasons are considerably less exciting than the first two. Or maybe they’re the same level of excitement, but we’ve just seen it for 40 hours straight.</li>
<li>That being said, watching the first two seasons is a definite time drain. It’s really tough not to watch “just one more”</li>
</ul><p class="p1"><strong>Ugly</strong></p>
<ul><li>Not sure why I really have this category… #oldwesterns #conformist</li>
<li>Quite a few gruesome scenes; I won’t spoil them, but just be warned.</li>
<li>Plenty of attractive cast members become less attractive over the course of the show due to things that happen to them/things they do.</li>
</ul><p class="p1">All in all, i was hesitant about this show at first but I really got hooked. The last two seasons are a bit shaky, but the first two are phenomenal in terms of storyline, theme, and character base. Definitely worth watching if you’ve got the time!</p>
