<p>Have you ever wanted to be in someone else&rsquo;s body? See what they see, feel what they feel, think as they think? To be honest, I haven&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve given the idea some serious consideration after watching this movie. Starring John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, this 1999 fantasy film explores the concept of metempsychosis (always wanted to use that word) in detail. In my opinion, one&rsquo;s life has got to really suck if they need to look out of someone else&rsquo;s eyes to be truly happy.</p>
<p>The basic premise is this: the main character finds a portal at his workplace that allows him to escape his own body and enter the mind of John Malkovich, famous actor and director, for 15 minutes. Throw in his repressed desire to be a puppeteer, a couple of sexually confused women, and a mysterious man who&rsquo;s far older than he should be, and you&rsquo;ve got one <strong>messed up</strong> movie. My two cents: watch it if you&rsquo;re in that trippy, half-asleep, pensive state. If you&rsquo;re wide awake/not in the mood to think patiently about what&rsquo;s going on, this will bore you instantly. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Thought-provoking, but way</strong><strong> too weird. 3.5/5 stars.</strong> </p>
