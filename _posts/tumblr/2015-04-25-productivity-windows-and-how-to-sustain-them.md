Productivity windows. We’ve all had them. Those pockets of a few minutes or hours where you’re not only more productive, but generally more interested in doing anything and everything that you usually neglect due to apathy or laziness. You know, when you suddenly have the drive to clean your room, take out all the trash in your apartment, go to the gym, start tackling your reading list... actually write a blog post! These short-lived pockets of productivity are great, but what creates them? And how does one sustain them?  For me, these productivity windows are typically borne out of the aftermath of completing a long and grueling project. After hours of focus, once the pressure has finally been lifted from my neck, I somehow feel underutilized and desire continued progress.

Generally, I end up doing one of the following:
* Ignore the feeling and go celebrate
* Complete a lot of menial tasks in rapid succession and quickly burn out
* Reflect, plan, and map out the next week or two of my time

The first option naturally makes no use of your productivity window, so we’ll disregard that immediately. The second option uses your productivity to maximum capacity for a short period of time, but analysis paralysis (an over-analysis of a situation with multiple options that leads to no action) stifles it quickly. The underlying problem is lack of a high-level plan; you’re forced to rely on yourself in the moment to keep producing tasks. Quickly, you’ll find yourself having completed a few menial tasks or gotten half way into other, larger tasks and quit because you’re tired of trying to determine which would constitute the optimal use of your time. That being said, this option is ideal in the short-run.

The final option is also beneficial, but why? In order to sustain your productivity window, you need to give yourself some purpose that extends beyond the immediate future, lest you succumb to the analysis-paralysis pitfall. Think about it like investing money won from a lottery; while the money itself might sustain you in the short-run, you need a continuous stream of income in the future. While this approach doesn’t fully utilize your window in the moment, it sets you up for productivity in the future.

The approach I try to employ synthesizes the above two by using to-do lists. I love lists because they separate the mental processes of deciding what to do from the processes of actually doing. By constantly maintaining a to-do list (extra optimization: partition it by task size), I’m prepared for my productivity windows. Essentially, I spare myself the effort of analysis and focus fully on pruning my list. Once I’m done, I take the time to map out a timeline for the larger tasks in my to-do list, giving myself a continued sense of purpose for the days that follow.

And there you have it! Productivity windows can indeed be sustained. Note that this analysis is based wholly on my own experience and your own mileage my vary. But if you’re someone that likes to write lists, reflect, and plan, you might find this useful.
