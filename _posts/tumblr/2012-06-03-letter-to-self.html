<p>If you’re perfectly content with life, read no further. I have nothing to offer but memories of who you once were.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I’m your 17 year old self. My interests include technology, rhetoric, and people. I like status quo, but I live for self-improvement. I have a growing penchant to learn as much as I can. I fear dispassion, forgetfulness, and apathy. I am occasionally apathetic. I fear myself sometimes.</p>
<p>I have a strong spiritual sense of myself and the world. My beliefs are firm, but I am too often humbled to set them in stone. I believe that an honest and learned man is one on the path toward success. I used to consider power as one’s ability to control a situation, but I now believe it lies in self-control and discipline. I believe happiness is a conscious and habitual choice. I believe in the rule of 3, but it, like many others, is broken when I have something to stand up for.</p>
<p>My biggest strengths are my self-awareness and sangfroid. My biggest weaknesses are my intractability in priorities, self-effacing character, and physical stature. I have more weaknesses than strengths, but I do not view that acknowledgement as one of them.</p>
<p>I define making a difference as positively impacting another’s happiness. I have made a difference before. I aspire to live a life where every moment is difference making. Do not forget that. Learning for its own sake, action with detachment, and embracing love are conscious choices that make this possible.</p>
<p>I am happy with who I am and I want to continue being so. Don’t be me, but be consistent with me. Amplify your strengths and ameliorate your weaknesses. Write and reflect; these are two actions which have never failed you before. Love someone unconditionally, it brings positivity to your life in a way that nothing else can. Be cognizant of the world but recognize that it is not all. Call your parents more than I do. Be okay with being afraid. Never grow cocky or complacent.</p>
<p>Be proud to look back at your 17 year old self and say: “This is who I am.”</p>
