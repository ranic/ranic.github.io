<p>I’m back.</p>
<p>After a year with a hell of a lot of change. A lot of change, but more ups than downs. That makes me happy. Many would be happy with much less.</p>
<p>Usually around this time I post a set of resolutions. This year, despite its net positive, has taught me not to be so optimistic.</p>
<p>Resolutions are externalities. They are by definition that which you are not. That which you aspire to be. For many, tangible resolutions (losing 10 lbs, getting a 4.0) work just fine &ndash; they are fantastic personal goals and the new year is an apt time to start working on them. But often, the intangible ones are the ones of consequence, and the ones with which we struggle the most. I&rsquo;m talking about improving personal relationships, building confidence, staying positive and motivated. Where these creatures are concerned, continuous, conscious <em><strong>resolve</strong> </em>is everything.<!-- more --></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down. <strong>Continuous </strong>means around the clock, whether you&rsquo;re working, relaxing, moving, or standing still. <strong>Conscious,</strong> in conjunction with continuous,means that you must constantly be aware of your goal. <strong>Resolve</strong>&hellip; well resolve simply means that you must persevere until your resolution is internalized. Until it is no longer the complaint of that which you are not, but the joy of what you are. Until the thought of separation from the resolution is as profoundly foreign as forgetting your own name.</p>
<p>Humans are stubborn creatures; we are psychologically built to preserve our attitudes and behaviors. So when we decide that these attitudes and behaviors are due for transformation, we must become relentless emissaries of change. It is not some miraculous transformation that will cause us to meet our resolution, nor is it impossible to do so. It is that process of <strong>continuous, conscious resolve </strong>that affects positive change. It is only once that process stops being an externality and starts becoming as natural as breathing that we can sigh with relief. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s power and comfort in being able to internalize your resolutions as resolve. The tough part is breaking the inertia and making that initial leap. Once you do, keeping looking forward.</p>
