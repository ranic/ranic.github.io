<p>Hey everyone!<br/><br/>For all my die-hard fans (the one or two of you out there), I&rsquo;m sorry that I haven&rsquo;t posted much on here recently. Today, I&rsquo;ll make up for my absence with several posts, beginning with this one. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Mindful: <strong>bearing in mind, inclined to be aware</strong></em> (Merriam-Webster)</p>
<p><em>Chaos: <strong>the confused, unorganized state of primordial </strong></em>(M-W)</p>
<p>So why did I chose this cacophonous verbal juxtaposition as my blog&rsquo;s heading? Well first, in hipster spirit, I needed a combination of words that&rsquo;s vaguely thought-provoking but not in the cliche way. However, even I&rsquo;m not so shallow as to <em>mindlessly</em> conform to this obscurely trite veneer of intellectualism (OK, enough thesaurus.com jargon.) In reality, I had two reasons (aside from the one above) for choosing <em>Mindful Chaos</em> as my blog&rsquo;s title: </p>
<p><strong>First: </strong>I like the duality of it. In an out-of-body, synesthetic experience, I visualized &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; as an all-powerful yet utterly intractable creature of darkness. (Give me a break, after a childhood of anime and cartoons, this just resonated with me.) On its own, chaos razes everything in sight &ndash; if it can even be called a 'being&rsquo;, it is one of <span>mindless</span> destruction. Only those who are truly <em>mindful</em> can peacefully observe the existence of chaos and accept its presence. This duality isn&rsquo;t quite as black and white as I&rsquo;ve described - different levels of chaos and mindfulness pervade our universe - but it&rsquo;s a neat model.</p>
<p><strong>Second: </strong>Ever since I&rsquo;ve come across the word and its true definition, I&rsquo;ve sought to increase my own levels of mindfulness (to over 9000, perhaps?). However, since we live in such a crazy and chaotic world, everything I learn is sucked into the hopelessly tangled mess that is my mind. I created this blog to untangle this knot of 17 years, bit by bit, with the belief that I can one day tame the chaotic beast of my world. </p>
<p>And you thought I was a hipster <em>before</em>. :) </p>
