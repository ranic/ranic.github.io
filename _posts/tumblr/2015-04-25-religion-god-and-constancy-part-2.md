In Part 1, I discussed the benefits and pitfalls of religion by breaking it into three parts: culture, community, and comfort. While that was all well and good, it still leaves the unanswered question: Why do we believe in God? What is God?

My typical visits to the temples are pretty mundane; I make my rounds, perform the necessary rituals, reflect, and frankly get a little bored towards the end. My mom, however, almost always has a more significant experience, explaining it as “feeling the strength of God course through her.” She’s not unique in this regard; several older family members seem to feel an intimate connection with God in some form. I chalked up my inability to understand this to my attempts to rationalize that which obviously cannot be rationalized.

That is, until last week when I visited the Pittsburgh SV Temple with my mom. When the darshan began and my mom seemed to elevate to her usual state, I felt something unusual as well. I began to feel a sense of elation that lifted the tension from my shoulders. Eager to discover more, I delved further into the moment and for a timeless interval, I felt truly and profoundly happy...

...until my brain kicked me back into rationalization mode. It was now or never; I had to figure out what exactly happened. There must be a way to explain it. I reflected for about an hour, and it finally hit me.

We live in a world of constant flux; we spend our lives attempting to fulfill an often poorly defined sense of purpose while struggling to maintain footing on a continuously shifting, uncontrollable environment. This is true from a theoretical standpoint too. Consider the Second Law of Thermodynamics: disorder (entropy) in the universe is always increasing. Unfortunately, even human brains are not well-equipped to deal with change at this scale -- imagine having to constantly evaluate whether your circumstances or environment have changed. To ameliorate this slightly, we make *many, many* assumptions about constancy: that assignment deadlines won’t change, that our friends will stand by us, that we won’t get Ebola... but it’s impossible to know for sure. Constancy, absolute constancy, is a futile illusion.

So what did humans do when they realized there was nothing constant in the world? Simple: **we invented it.** Enter God. By definition, God is timeless and eternal, above the omnipresent force of entropy (See [The Last Question](http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html). God is the fixed buoy in a universe of otherwise tumultuous waters and that brings us a profound sense of relief.

But why God? Why something anthropomorphic with rituals, stories, and so much bloodshed in its name? That sounds like a really complicated abstraction for constancy. I argue that one can reap identical benefits by simply meditating, which is explicit focus on constancy. God in His current forms only exists because we’re unable to meditate properly and require a more colorful abstraction to dispel the flux and focus.

My takeaway from my profound experience at the temple was not a rejuvenation of my religious beliefs. It was the understanding that **God is abstraction for constancy**. By shedding the abstraction, disciplined individuals are able to achieve the same effect by meditation, or concerted focus on a singular thought. Until I master that, however, God will have to do.
