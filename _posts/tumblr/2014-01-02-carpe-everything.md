I've been re-evaluating the way I spend my time; it's something I want to better in 2014. It's started to hit me that I'm entering my prime. The next 10 years constitute my mental and physical peak. This is the period in which I enjoy the most opportunities. I should be excited, but really, I'm anxious. It's like being given $100,000,000 with the caveat that you lose $1,000,000 a day. Naturally you would want to spend it as soon as possible, but you also must allot time for determining the best use of that money. Is it worth spending $1,000,000 frivolously today when you can determine a better use for it tomorrow? These are akin to the tradeoffs we face in life; should we spend time planning or doing?

I'm a pretty passive person. I like to plan, reflect, think and even relax my mental faculties. But the time for all of that is coming to an end. This is the point in my life whereÂ *doing* yields the greatest return on investment. One day, I won't have a choice but to sit around and think or watch TV or read old books. But now is the time that I have all the choice. I have a fully developed brain that's aching for exercise and a body that is both impervious and resilient. Today is not meant to be planned. It's meant to be seized.

At a time when everything is laid out for me, the only true enemy is apathy. The inertia that causes me to sit in sedation, resisting inspiration or change. This apathy causes us to forget that right now all we have are tomorrows, where one day we'll have only yesterdays. It is time to seize tomorrow. Seize tonight. Seize today. Seize everything.
