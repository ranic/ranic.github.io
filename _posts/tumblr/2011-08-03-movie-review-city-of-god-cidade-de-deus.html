<p>In a nutshell, <em>City of God </em>is the precursor to <em>Slumdog Millionaire. </em>However, it is a hundred times rawer, a thousand times more realistic, and a million times more fast paced. In a way, it&rsquo;s a fusion of <em>Slumdog Millionaire </em>and <em>Scarface</em>, telling the story of both a young power-monger&rsquo;s self-destructive transformation into druglord of his poverty stricken city and the parallel one of an adolescent who refuses to resign himself to his destiny as a &ldquo;hood&rdquo;, seeking a more legitimate lifestyle. These two starkly contrasting paths are so tightly wound that they can be recounted in flawless, linear fashion. If you&rsquo;re not already convinced, let me give you three reasons why this is one of the greatest movies of all time.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s incredibly dense with action and character development. The story is told from the point-of-view of a very involved narrator, one who understands which information is important and which isn&rsquo;t. The result is a film in which <em>every minute</em> is crucial, packed with information. Secondly, it&rsquo;s impossible to hate any one character. Though some are undoubtedly more brutal than others, there is never a moment that suggests that their actions are &ldquo;inhuman&rdquo;. In fact, I believe that the sheer <em>humanness </em>of the entire film can be overwhelming at points, a testament to its realism. Lastly, the actors are absolutely fantastic. As trite a platitude as this is often considered, their portrayals of the characters literally transport you to the world that you&rsquo;re viewing. I also recommend watching the movie in its original Portuguese form with English subtitles; it&rsquo;s so much more epic.<br/><br/><strong>Very highly recommended. 5/5 stars.</strong>Â </p>
