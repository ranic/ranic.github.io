<p>In my pilgrimage through top movies of the 90&rsquo;s, I came across Sam Mendes&rsquo; <em>American Beauty, </em>starring Kevin Spacey. The movie is a lot like <em>Fight Club</em> in its nihilistic, almost forlorn, portrayal of life and its destruction of the fourth wall between the protagonist and audience. Spacey plays a despondent middle-aged telemarketer at a faceless corporation. His marriage with a fairly unsuccessful real estate agent is the pinnacle of apathy. His completely deteriorated relationship with his teenage daughter simply adds insult to injury, rubs salt in all his failures. His life changes drastically, however, when he develops an almost animalistic sexual desire for his daughter&rsquo;s cheerleader friend.</p>
<p>The film very viscerally explores themes of apathy, sexual repression, and the ultimate failure of the American dream. Mendes adds a few more characters to this despotic mess as the movie progresses, touching on the unspoken homophobia and intolerance that plagues suburban America. The best part of the movie, however, is that it leaves traces of hope everywhere. These tendrils, however faint, evidence the fact that life at it&rsquo;s lowest has nowhere to go but up. </p>
<p><br/><strong><em>If you&rsquo;re looking for a thought-provoking and raw film, you&rsquo;ve got it. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>4.5/5 stars</em></strong> </p>
