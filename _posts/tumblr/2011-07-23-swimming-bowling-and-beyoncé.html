<p>Tip of the day:</p>
<p><strong><em>Having something exciting planned is better than any alarm.</em></strong></p>
<p><span> </span>I guess that&rsquo;s why I woke up so easily this morning, because I was going to see a few of my closest friends. It was my first time visiting Garrett&rsquo;s (and Jenny&rsquo;s) <strike>house</strike> mansion, and I was absolutely amazed. Beautiful interior decorating combined with a well-maintained indoor pool = GREAT afternoon. Jon soon came over, sweating profusely after what was apparently a 14 mile bike ride, and joined the three of us in a game of Torpedo. Torpedo is pretty much underwater soccer with a dart-like &ldquo;ball&rdquo;. <!-- more -->While Jon and I couldn&rsquo;t match the chemistry of &lsquo;Jenny and Garrett&rsquo; Flack, we put up a great fight. Too bad Jon let in <strong>all </strong>the goals.</p>
<p><span> </span>As evening came, we picked up my bro Phillip Suh and headed to a Korean restaurant managed by Alex Kim&rsquo;s family. Our little mini-reunion was replete with nostalgic flashbacks to past relationships and mountains of food to drown out the sexual tension. But seriously, great food, great times. At the end of it all, we were given a special ice cream dessert by Alex&rsquo;s dad &ndash; his treat!</p>
<p><span> </span>Our next stop was <em>Eskape</em> entertainment for an hour of bowling. We picked our names after the worst decisions in our lives, except Phil, who chose the best :). After growing bored of normal technique and getting repeatedly shown up by an ebony bowling god, we decided to try curving the ball with our full arm. Worth all the gutter balls. On the drive to drop everyone back, we blasted Beyoncé, Maroon 5, SNSD, and more&hellip; singing together like a family. &lt;3 </p>
