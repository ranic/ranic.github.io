<p>I watched this movie two days ago and since then, it&rsquo;s consumed every lobe of my brain, seeped through every pore in my skin, and infused with every globule of my blood. Writing a review for this film in my stylized, mundane, and formulaic prose would do it no justice; I do so only to bring my obsession to, what I hope will be, a constructive and peaceful end. Melodrama aside, let the endorsement begin.</p>
<p>I cannot think of any movie that surpasses this one in sheer realism, cinematography, or underlying message. From the director of <em>Pi</em> (1998), <em>The Wrestler (2008), </em>and <em>Black Swan (2010)</em> comes a thrilling masterpiece that drags the viewer into the spiraling abyss of addiction. <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> explores the lives of four closely related characters, their respective addictions, and how this underlying dependance drives them to act in ways so profoundly self-destructive that they seemingly violate all that it means to be human.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip; there is something so profoundly human about this movie. The ability to dream &ndash; not just in the literal &lsquo;sleeping&rsquo; sense &ndash; is one of the most beautiful aspects of human existence. In modern society, we exalt those who have stood for their dreams and brought them to fruition, trusting them with leadership and power. Just as dreams are our most precious asset, addiction is our most dangerous enemy. As the latter begins to control us, whether its medium be heroin, diet pills, or masturbation, our dreams are lost forever.</p>
<p>The word <em>requiem</em> refers to the Roman Mass for the dead. The famous dirge that we&rsquo;re so used to hearing in teaser trailers and 'epic&rsquo; movie soundtracks is a central theme of this movie. Indeed, the movie&rsquo;s title mourns the death, rather <strong>the murder</strong>, of human dreams once we reach the nadir of our existence: addiction.<br/><br/><strong>In summary: </strong>Fantastic cinematography, flawless confluence of action and rest, and a darkly powerful, incredibly thought-provoking underlying message. I recommend this movie more than any other you care to name.</p>
<p><strong><em>5 stars out of 5 &ndash; can&rsquo;t say much more than that.</em></strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Warning: </strong>The weak of heart or stomach should <em>not</em>  watch this. Be prepared to handle flashes of sex, excessive drug use, and grotesque, uncensored, surgical procedures. The last 20 minutes are gripping to the point of suffocation, but well worth the watch. </p>
