<p class="p1">The brand new, 13-episode, Netflix-only, remake of a British novel-cum-BBC series, House of Cards is a riveting political drama that tells the tale of a House Majority Whip who, when passed up for a promotion to Secretary of State, nefariously and calculatedly plots for power absolute.<!-- more --></p>
<p class="p1">And believe it or not, that single run-on sentence summary brings you, my dear reader, about 50% of the way to understanding House of Cards in its entirety. The other 50%? Kevin Spacey takes the main role.</p>
<p class="p1">But seriously, if you’re looking for a witty, fast-paced, and engaging political drama with a strong cast of characters, look no further than the first episode of House of Cards. No, I mean that “look no further” part absolutely literally. Because if you do look further, you’ll find yourself immersed in the highly viscous molasses of a plot that takes its sweet (see what I did there?) time in degrading your faith in politicians, journalists, and just about everyone in between.</p>
<p class="p1">The only reasons I stuck with the plot after the first (okay, I’ll give it more credit — second) episode were:</p>
<ul><li><span>Spacey’s brilliantly dry humor</span></li>
<li><span>The attractiveness of his wife</span></li>
<li><span>The fact that Netflix automatically pushes you to the next episode and, it being spring</span><span> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"></span><span>break, I didn’t have the effort to press the well-needed Esc key.</span></li>
</ul><p class="p2">Apparently House of Cards is all the rage though, so if you want to keep up with mediocre mainstream television (or if you want to challenge what I’ve said here), have at it. It is a must-watch for Spacey fans, though.</p>
