<p><span>Dr. King provided many great services for America. He gave voice to a people who had long been silenced. He catalyzed a movement whose time had come. We’ve heard it all before and there’s no getting around it… Dr. King was a doer. He was a </span><span>drum major of positive change</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>But he wasn’t born this way.  By all accounts, he led a very normal childhood in the South &ndash; occasionally marred by racial segregation. He was mature for his age, excelling academically to graduate high school at the age of 15 and, despite being born into a line of Baptist pastors, wary of his religion’s claims for most of that time. In short, he was a precocious, intelligent, and skeptical teenager… sounds pretty familiar here at Carnegie Mellon.<!-- more --></span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>As Dr. King moved into his college years, he critically analyzed a myriad of social philosophers: Aristotle, Rosseau, Locke, Theoreau. I argue that in this time, while he formally studied sociology, he was informally a student of </span><span>moral education.</span><span> It was the latter that he himself considered most value-adding; in his college newspaper, Dr. King wrote: “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&ldquo; This, I argue, transformed that teenager into a force of nature. </span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Fast forward 70 years. We live in a world driven by transistors&hellip; and as an engineer, I </span><span>thrive on it</span><span>. From my years of inquiry at the Illinois Math and Science Academy, or IMSA, to my engineering education here at CMU, I’ve been fortunate to receive the </span><span>technical</span><span> building blocks to </span><span>advance the human condition</span><span>. But as Dr. King says, this education is incomplete without its moral counterpart. Even here, in this steel factory of critical thinkers and technologists, we must first strive to </span><span>understand the human condition</span><span> before we can hope to advance it.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>This is neither a new problem nor an intractable one. At IMSA, a school that prides itself for a rigorous technical curriculum, the </span><span>study of ethics</span><span> was equally prioritized. Upperclassmen and faculty facilitated weekly sessions in which we would dissect the work of various philosophers, such as Mill, Kant, Marx, and Rawls in the context of ethics… by no means a “soft” area of study. However, for me, the impact </span><span>went beyond</span><span> that of understanding the history of human struggle. </span></p>
<p><span>I am born to two software engineers and have spent most of my life in the upper-middle class suburbs of Chicago. I’m fortunate to have led a fairly privileged life, certainly compared to those of some of my peers. The main impact of these conversations was exposure to the diverse, and sometimes adverse, backgrounds of those around me &ndash; these conversations broke boundaries.  </span><span>Moral education breaks boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span>But we don’t grow up reading treatises on social philosophy and clearly we have some sense of morality. A large part of this comes from life experience, but speaking for myself, I must credit </span><span>faith </span><span>for some of my moral development. And I’m not alone. </span><span>Reverend </span><span>Martin Luther King Jr. was a man of faith. As a proponent of the Social Gospel movement, he believed in developing a religious rationale for tackling problems such as racial inequality and poverty. However, Reverend King’s moral view was not limited by his particular faith. In fact, Mohandas Gandhi, </span><span>a Hindu</span><span>, is often cited as his biggest influence. The Mahatma drew from Vedanta to develop the principle of Ahimsa, or nonviolence, a </span><span>focal point </span><span>of both his and Dr. King’s movements. Dr. King drew ideals from his own faith and that of Gandhi to develop his own set of convictions and beliefs. In doing so, he exemplified the immense possibility that not faith alone, but </span><span>INTER</span><span>-faith, affords us.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Last year, as part of OM, the organization for Indian spirituality and culture on campus, I organized an interfaith discussion event called “Spirituality meets Religion”. With representation from various religious groups, we contrasted and compared our religious symbols and spiritual values. Of course, we aren&rsquo;t seasoned religious scholars &ndash; the purpose was to see how </span><span>students </span><span>who subscribed to different faiths could interrelate. Each group boasted a distinct set of rituals, stories, deities, and ideals. However, while different, the moral values spoke </span><span>a language we could all understand</span><span>. Charity, humility, altruism, fairness. These are </span><span>values that unite, </span><span>rather than segregate.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Dr. King provided many great services for America. But his greatest may not yet be realized. It calls us to action today, to supplement our world-class technical education with the moral variety. It compels us to read and appreciate the history of human struggle through the writing of social and ethical philosophers. To have these discussions with our roommates, classmates, organization leaders, or professors at CMU and be exposed to the diverse perspectives and backgrounds of those around us. To step out of our comfort zone and integrate faith into these conversations, embracing the rich set of values that emerge. Act on this call when you leave here today, not only as a service to the human condition but to honor the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you.</span></p>
