<p><span>You may have noticed the influx of my verbose posts on your dashboard. No, I haven&rsquo;t yet degraded to blogging every moment of my day &ndash; I&rsquo;m just migrating posts from my more clandestine other Tumblr to this one. I&rsquo;m doing this to divide my two blogs by privacy; this one, vijayiyengar.tumblr.com, will contain my opinions, book/movie reviews, and some reflective posts.</span><span>My other one is more of a personal journal.</span></p>
<p><span>In case you haven&rsquo;t read some of these recently migrated posts, I urge you to check them out. If you agree with my opinions, awesome! If not, I&rsquo;d be glad to hear some feedback.Â </span></p>
