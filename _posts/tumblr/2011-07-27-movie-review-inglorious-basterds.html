<p>Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s highest grossing film to date, <em>Inglorious Basterds </em>(yes, spelled correctly) tells the story of two simultaneous, yet independent, assassination plots. The target? All the major players of the Third Reich, Hitler included. At almost 2.5 hours, the film is filled with twists, dark humor, and, in classic Tarantino style, enormous amounts of gore. I watched this movie mainly because of its high ranking on IMDB and I see now why it&rsquo;s held in such regard. The movie is centered around the atrocities of war, how the simple strategic decisions of higher-ups can easily destroy so many civilian lives.</p>
<p>Being about the second World War, a good 80% of the dialogue is <strong>not</strong>Â in English; the characters either converse in French or German. Subtitles are present for only some of the conversation, imbuing certain scenes with a sense of mystery that remains unresolved until the very end. While this language and setting would normally give such a film a foreign quality, Tarantino brings us back home with several &lsquo;all-American&rsquo; soldiers whose overblown patriotism and almost comical ruthlessness are a testament to the days of cowboys and Mexican standoffs. All in all a funny, bloody, and dramatic movie with the Brad Pitt cherry thrown on top.</p>
<p><strong>4.5/5 stars.</strong></p>
