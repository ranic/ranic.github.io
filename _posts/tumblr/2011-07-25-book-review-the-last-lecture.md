For those who don't know, Randy Pausch, a former CMU computer science professor, was terminally diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August, 2007. He was told by his doctor that he had 3 to 6 months left to live, at most. After watching his last lecture and reading the accompanying book (co-authored by Jeffrey Zaslow), I was amazed to see how extraordinarily resourceful one could be in one's last months of life. Never in his book does Pausch complain of his impending death or lament that he has lost so much time with his family. Certainly, he harbors these regrets. But what's amazing is that none of them holds him back.

If anything, he views his scheduled death as a blessing, one that allows him to do what most people never have a chance to: document his entire life. He does so with an astounding clarity and attention to detail, unabashed as only a dying man could be. If you wish to read this, read carefully, because each page is rife with witticisms and advice. The book is not about death, as one might expect. It's not even really about "living life to the fullest", a cliche that fuels the self-help market. It's about never letting go of those childhood dreams and doing all in your power to realize them.

**Highly recommend this. 5/5 stars.**
