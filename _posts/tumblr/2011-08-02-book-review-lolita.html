<p>Picture a 40 year old man wandering around children&rsquo;s parks and playgrounds, sitting down under a tree, pretending to read, but instead casting his lecherous eyes on the small groups of girls innocently gathered to play hopscotch. Now give this man a friendly, somewhat humorous name: &ldquo;Humbert Humbert&rdquo;. Consider that every moment of his existence is punctuated by a powerful sexual infatuation for the girls above. Take note of the fact that the love of his childhood life, Annabel, passed away in the pinnacle of their relationship. Now imagine him attempting to seduce a 12-year-old girl, in whose home he is but a tenant, into having sex with him. Would you believe me if I said that it is <em>she</em>, not he, who does the seducing? If you do, you&rsquo;re ready to enter the world of <em>Lolita.</em></p>

<p>Effusive yet unreliable narration, tragicomedic satire of American life, and several ornately written, borderline pornographic, scenes make <em>Lolita</em> one of the greatest books of the 20th century. However, it is somewhat of an acquired taste. I admit that my own main motivation to read the novel stemmed from its nigh immortal literary status &ndash; I warn that such determination fades brutally fast. If you choose to read <em>Lolita</em>, give yourself some time to soak in the enormous amounts of detail and fantastic prose; it&rsquo;s well worth the effort.<br/><br/><em><strong>Status: Timeless. If you&rsquo;re up for the challenge, read it now! </strong></em></p>
