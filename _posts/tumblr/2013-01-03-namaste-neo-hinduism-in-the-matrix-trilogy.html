<p class="MsoNormal">In the past two days, I’ve skimmed some of my favorite scenes in the Wachowski’s brothers’ magnum opus: The Matrix Trilogy. When I first watched the three R-rated films at the appropriate age of 10, I understood just enough of the multifaceted plot to deeply enjoy the well-choreographed fight scenes and “witty” (not really) banter. I remember having memorized the scene numbers of all the fights and knowing how to jump straight to them using scene selection on the DVD player. Who still uses that, by the way?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I re-watched the trilogy in high school and retained a slightly greater understanding of what I considered a highly self-obfuscating plot. Wait, so Neo made a choice to be the One? And those Indian programs destroyed the ‘outer shell’ of the Oracle in exchange for safe passage for their daughter? The Architect is a program too? Don’t take my word on these… they’re just my more educated conjectures from high school.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, though I still watch the movie for the epic 100-on-1 battles and meta dialogues, I cannot help but think how much the Matrix is an entertaining manifestation of Hindu philosophy. Indeed, the Wachowski brothers readily admit to having incorporated elements of the ancient faith in their work; hell, the music playing in the trilogy finale is a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navras" title="Navras Mantra in Matrix"> mantra found in the Upanisads</a>! Here’s my list of the 4 biggest connections between the Matrix trilogy and Hinduism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Semantic note: I use the terms Sanatan Dharma, Vedantic tradition, and Dharmic tradition, all of which refer to the Hindu body of thought.</p>
<p>    1<strong>. The Matrix (proper) = Maya</strong></p>
<p>One of the fundamental tenets of Sanatan Dharma Philosophy is the notion of <em>Maya</em> — that the world we experience is an elaborate illusion. So important is this concept of <em>maya </em>that the very purpose of life is <em>moksha</em>, liberation from this illusion. If you’re wondering how this ties to the Matrix… just read about three sentences from any synopsis of it.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">    2. <strong>Detachment as a virtue</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In many Hindu texts, the Gita in particular, detachment from the results of one’s actions is considered a powerful virtue. In fact, detachment from this false reality, this Maya, is how one attains moksha. In a more practical sense, Dharmic texts advocate detachment as a means to achieve humility, peace of mind, and improved focus. In the original Matrix movie, Neo’s body is first exposed to the real world. He realizes, however, that to wield a demigod-like power, he must detach his mind from the Matrix as well. In doing so (eg. “there is no spoon”) he is capable of anything, from bending spoons to stopping bullets.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>    3. Anthropomorphic God and Avatars</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several religions, most prominently the Abrahamic ones, forbid idolatry. Their texts claim that it is a sin to depict God in any worldly form. It would perhaps be an even greater outrage if their God walked on Earth as a fairly normal human being. Some mortal beings come close, messiahs for instance, but they are still separate from this indescribable God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Vedic tradition, we are all “God’! Vishishtadvaita, a common school of Vedantic thought, literally means qualified non-dualism: that everything is one, but has describable qualities. Thus, it is perfectly admissible for a “god” to step on Earth. In the Matrix, Mr. Anderson is a normal human being. But as we soon discover, he is actually the human manifestation of some godlike power – the One. In fact, he has had 5 other human predecessors, all of whom wielded this power. This parallels the existence of avatars in Hindu philosophy, which are human forms taken by a God to rid the world of some evil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>    4. Cyclic reality</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Hindu timeline is based on the 4 yugas (actually, it’s based on the days of the God Brahma, but that’s too involved a topic for this post). Each yuga is an epoch and after the four are done, the world comes to an end, beginning anew with the first Yuga. Each individual yuga serves a different purpose, but in the grand scheme of things, the iterations are virtually the same. There exists the same maya, with the same evil forces, with the same avatars of God coming to Earth to liberate human beings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I mentioned in 3., the Matrix has had several iterations of the One. Each meets with the designer of the system (The Architect) and reloads the system, thereby restarting the Matrix. This cyclic reality mirrors the one discussed in Vedic texts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several more connections between the Matrix and Sanatan Dharma, such as the ideas of Karma, Dharma, and Free Will. Unfortunately, I myself am not well versed enough in these more subtle areas to be able to give too accurate of a description of how they fit in with the Matrix. I’ll revisit them when I learn more. Hope you found this a more thought-provoking look at an awesome trilogy!</p>
