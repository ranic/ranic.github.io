One of my favorite reads this year has been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095" target="_blank">Sapiens</a> by Yuval Harari. I was most impressed by the clarity of Harari's thesis and the brevity of his traversal of human history to support that thesis. In this post, I attempt to distill the book's core ideas as a handy reference for myself and others.

My summary of Harari's thesis is: <b>Homo Sapiens thrives above other species due to the ability to create and persist collective beliefs, or fictions, which enable powerful, self-reinforcing social structures. </b> This idea is profound in its simple ubiquity. Money is a fiction in that its value comes from our collective belief of its worth. Religion unites otherwise disparate peoples over a common, and powerfully unfalsifiable, set of ideas that our ancestors invented. Nations bring people together (and keep them apart) over a mutually agreed upon, albeit arbitrary, set of boundaries.
</p>

Beyond this thesis, <i>Sapiens</i> provides a great timeline of the history of our species from 400,000 BC to now. This falls into the category of "stuff you should know but never quite learned in school", with a spattering of cocktail-party worthy history facts. For example, the human brain was created to absorb zoological, botancial, natural data in visual forms. We developed methods of encoding and filing data (alphabets) to flush this information from our brain. Another fun one: Americans spend more money on diets than is required to feed all the hungry people of the world.

One of the final chapters of <i>Sapiens</i> questions whether any of this advancement really makes us any happier. I was pleasantly surprised to read this section, given the otherwise scientific and objective nature of the book. The crux of the argument is that happiness is not explicitly selected for the way longevity and reproductive health are. Thus, as we "advance", we simply live longer and work harder to support the growing number of fictions that now encumber us (money, religion, nationalism)... but are we any happier? Harari affirms that the only real factor in our happiness is our expectations. He references a study in which a few months after both positively and negatively impactful events, one's happiness returns to an equilibrium level. Our expectations, he argues, are the greatest predictor of our happiness. I can see how this can be construed negatively or produce apathy, but I derived some comfort from this statement (perhaps another fiction?). By working to shape our expectations, we can improve our happiness level while impervious to external factors. That's empowering.

 I have plenty more to share about <i>Sapiens</i>, but all my insights are better told in the book itself. Whether you're looking for general knowledge, anthropology facts, or philosophical musings on what makes us human, this is an excellent read that I cannot recommend enough!
