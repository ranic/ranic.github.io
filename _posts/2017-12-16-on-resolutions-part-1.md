<!--[](){:target=_"blank"}-->

Each year, I enumerate a set of resolutions for myself. For 2017, in an effort to better my odds of success, I separated my resolutions into two parts: accomplishments and habits.

The former were a list of unambiguous success criteria: run a half marathon at X pace, be able to do Y push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, read Z books, make T trips etc. 

The latter consisted of items like: limit sweets to one per day, only speak kindly of others, read before bed, wake up before 7 daily, etc.

Any goal requires some enforcement. The notorious challenge of resolutions comes from the self-imposed, and thus easy to evade, enforcement. My personal “accountability hack” was that every time I made progress on an achievement (e.g. read another book or took a trip), I revisited my document to mark it. When I did so, I inevitably re-read my habits too and reset my resolve to meet them.

Spoiler alert: this didn't work. Of my 40-ish achievements/habits, only 55% succeeded. Some notable failures:
* **Write 30 blog posts this year**: Yeah... no. This post is my second this year.
* **Workout before work**: Can count the number of successes on two hands.
* **No binge watching**: In the 2 weeks after inaugaration day, I watched the first 3 seasons of the West Wing. (though this might fall under "therapy" or "denying reality". #noshame)

That said, I did enjoy a few wins, which I include here for completeness (and a not-so-subtle #humblebrag?):
* **Ran a half-marathon at an <8-min pace**
* **Read 26 books** (list forthcoming)
* **Met personal finance targets** (without \*blah\*coin!)
* **Planned and made 12 overnight trips**


Upon reflecting on my wins and losses, I learned a few lessons about what works:
* **Adapt**: Life is random and resolutions arbitrary, be proactive and adapt.
* **Be Simple**: Resolutions with unambiguous outcomes were best met.
* **Bias to Action**: Of two otherwise equal goals, pick the more actionable one.
* **Focus on Habits**: Accomplishments come naturally with the right habits.
* **Prioritize**: Willpower is too limited to waste on “kinda important” things.

The bottom-line? Keep a simple list of habits, bias to action, and be open to revisiting. With my 2018 resolutions, and their accompanying strategy, I believe I’ve done just that. To be continued.
