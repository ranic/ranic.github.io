In my last post, I outlined lessons learned from my 2017 resolutions. Here, I present my resolutions for 2018.

“But it’s not even January 1st yet!”, I hear you say. This year, I set my resolutions on *December 1st*. I’m using December as my trial period to determine which habits are natural/realistic. If some habits turn out to be trivially easy, impractical, or useless, I can adjust my list accordingly. Ultimately, I consider this a stepping stone to a cadence of self-improvement that’s continuous, rather than biased toward the holidays.

**Goal**: Build sustainable habits that make me healthy, happy, and productive.
**Principle(s)**: Keep it simple, adaptable, and actionable, stupid. (KISAAS?)

**Habits/Strategies**
* Spend the last half hour of each day reading
    * Strategies: Stock my Kindle weekly with interesting books. Don’t read anything short-form (<10 pages) to improve my ability to read deeply.
* Break a sweat daily
    * Strategies: Sign up for events that require training. Have a set of exercises I can do with minimal equipment at home/work on days I can’t make it to the gym.
* Don’t watch TV/Youtube alone
    * Strategies: Social policing. Feel free to trip me up by asking if I’ve watched something and then checking who I watched it with!
* Check phone/communication channels only 4 times a day
    * Strategies: Social policing. Deleting social apps from my phone. Turning off push notifications. More on this in a future post.
* Brush and floss nightly
    * Strategies: Do it until I feel gross without it.
* Speak solutions, not problems
    * Strategies: Pause for a second before speaking, and evaulate if I'm about to say something negative. If so, and it's *not* accompanied by a proposal to resolve that negative thing, don't say it.
* Set aside 8 hours each weekend for creativity and self-improvement
    * Strategies: Put time on my calendar to go to a public workspace each weekend. Maintain lists of things to read/learn/prototype in this "intellectual play" time.
* Record all goods purchased and donate a matching amount to charity
    * Strategies: This one’s easy. As an aside, this means I should only buy things that I need enough to be willing to part with twice the price (modulo the intrinsic value of giving!).

These are by no means set in stone; indeed I have made some edits to this in the past few weeks as I integrate these habits into my life. 

As you may have guessed, I’m open-sourcing this primarily as fodder for being called out. As I navigate toward improvement, I happily welcome the crowd-sourced accountability of my peers. :) 

Thanks for reading and happy holidays!
